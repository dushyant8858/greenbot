# FAQ

## Motivation 

To help organizations reduce carbon footprint.

## Why Not AWS Trusted Advisor

* It's a great tool but I felt it is somewhat biased and falls short in various aspects like it will never recommend you to switch to m6g instances or t3a instances
* Also its paid!

## **Is it safe to use GreenBot**

* GreenBot will **never** modify any AWS resource in your account
* Permission for all rules are listed explicitly 
* Open-source!
